# Overview

I have a desire to learn SQL to prepare myself for future employement. My wife and I have developed a impressive small library. To keep record of all the books that we have, A database was needed. To learn the basics of SQL I implemented the commands SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE in my interactive Python program.

The program will display an array of options to interact with the database. Do you want to add a new book, delete, edit, or view the inventory. 


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database
SQLite is a database that is compatably with Python.

There is one table that includes the Title of the book, Author, Genre, and the year it was written.

# Future Work


- I would like to add another table that would be a check out functionality that would register
the book a that is currently out of the library being read.

- I would like to include the books description in the database.

- Fix the display to more visually pleasing.
